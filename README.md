Model used is sequential neural network model (using TensorFlow's Keras API).

Training a neural network model to classify images of clothing using TensorFlow. Here's a summary of the key steps:

1. Import Libraries: TensorFlow and helper libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib are imported.

2. Load Dataset: The Fashion MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, is loaded directly from TensorFlow.

3. Explore Data: The shape and format of the dataset are examined, including the dimensions of the images and labels.

4. Preprocess Data: Pixel values of the images are scaled to a range of 0 to 1 to normalize the data.

5. Visualize Data: The first 25 images from the training set are displayed along with their corresponding labels.

6. Build Model: A sequential neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API. It consists of a flattening layer followed by two densely connected layers.

7. Compile Model: The model is compiled with settings like optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

8. Train Model: The model is trained using the training data. Training involves feeding the data to the model, which learns to associate images with labels.

9. Evaluate Model: The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset to calculate accuracy.

10. Make Predictions: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data.

11. Visualize Predictions: Functions are defined to visualize prediction results, including displaying images, predicted labels, and prediction confidence percentages.

12. Verify Predictions: Several images from the test set are visualized along with their predicted labels and confidence percentages.
